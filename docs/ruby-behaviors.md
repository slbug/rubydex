## Namespace Qualification

Ruby uses `::` as the namespace separator and supports various ways of referencing namespaced entities.

### Name Qualification Context

The same unqualified name refers to different entities depending on context:

```ruby
class Bar  # Top-level Bar
end

module Foo
  class Bar  # Foo::Bar
  end

  puts Bar # Inside Foo, "Bar" means "Foo::Bar"
end

puts Bar # Outside Foo, "Bar" means "Bar" (top-level)
```

### Unqualified vs Qualified Names

**Unqualified names** are simple identifiers:

- `Foo`
- `Bar`
- `String`

**Qualified names** include namespace separators:

- `Foo::Bar`
- `ActiveRecord::Base`
- `Rails::Application::Configuration`

**Top-level references** start with `::`:

- `::Foo` (explicitly top-level)
- `::Array` (explicitly top-level)

**Rooted qualified names** combine both (starting with `::` and including namespace separators):

- `::ActiveRecord::Base` (explicitly top-level ActiveRecord, then Base within it)
- `::Rails::Application::Configuration` (navigates from top level through the namespace chain)

### Singleton Method Naming

Singleton methods (class methods) can use the same name as instance methods:

```ruby
class Foo
  def bar; end       # Instance method Foo#bar
  def self.bar; end  # Singleton method Foo.bar (or Foo::bar)
end
```

Both methods can coexist because they operate on different receivers:

- `Foo.new.bar` calls the instance method
- `Foo.bar` calls the singleton method

## Lexical Scoping and Constant Resolution

### Fully Qualified Name Resolution Rules

Ruby resolves names according to the current scope:

```ruby
class Bar; end
class Qux; end

module Foo
  class Bar; end     # Defines Foo::Bar
  # "Bar" => "Foo::Bar"
  # "::Bar" => "Bar" (top-level)

  class Baz
    class Qux; end   # Defines Foo::Baz::Qux
    # "Bar" => "Foo::Bar"
    # "Qux" => "Foo::Baz::Qux"
    # "::Qux" => "Qux" (top-level)
  end
end
```

**Rules:**

1. If the name starts with `::`, it refers to a top-level constant
2. Otherwise, the name is qualified relative to the current namespace
3. At the top level, unqualified names remain unqualified

### Top-Level References with `::`

Ruby's top-level constant resolution operator `::` resets the namespace to the root, but **lexical nesting is still preserved** for constant lookup. This is a critical and subtle behavior.

**Example:**

```ruby
module Foo
  CONST = 42

  class ::Bar
    CONST # resolves to Foo::CONST because we're inside the `Foo` namespace
  end
end

class Bar
  CONST # NameError because this `Bar` is not lexically inside `Foo`
end
```

**Key Points:**

- The class `::Bar` defined inside `Foo` has the fully qualified name `Bar` (not `Foo::Bar`)
- However, it is **still lexically connected** to `Foo` for constant resolution
- The second `Bar` definition (outside `Foo`) has no lexical connection to `Foo`, therefore needs to access `CONST` via `Foo::CONST`

### Compact Namespace Notation

Ruby supports compact namespace notation like `class Foo::Bar::Baz`, which creates multiple nesting levels in one declaration.

**Example:**

```ruby
class Foo::Bar
  class Baz::Qux; end
  class ::Quuux; end
end
```

This creates:

- `Foo::Bar`
- `Foo::Bar::Baz::Qux` (nested under `Foo::Bar`)
- `Quuux` (top-level, but lexically inside `Foo::Bar`)

**Important:** `Foo::Bar::Baz::Qux::Quuux` does **not** exist because `::Quuux` resets to top level.

## Definitions vs Declarations

A fundamental concept in Ruby is that classes and modules can be reopened and defined multiple times.

**Example:**

```ruby
module Foo
  class Bar; end
end

class Foo::Bar; end
```

This code creates:

**3 separate definitions:**

1. Module definition for `Foo`
2. Class definition for `Foo::Bar` (inside `Foo`)
3. Class definition for `Foo::Bar` (at top level)

**2 distinct declarations:**

1. The module `Foo`
2. The class `Foo::Bar`

**Key Points:**

- A **definition** is a single definition occurrence of a class, module, method, etc. in a specific file at a specific location
- A **declaration** represents the named entity that may have multiple definitions

## Method Parameters

Ruby has a rich and expressive parameter system with multiple parameter types.

### Parameter Types

```ruby
def method_name(
  a,           # Required positional parameter
  b = 42,      # Optional positional parameter (with default)
  *c,          # Rest positional parameter (splat)
  d,           # Post parameter (required positional after rest)
  e:,          # Required keyword parameter
  f: 42,       # Optional keyword parameter (with default)
  **g,         # Rest keyword parameter (double splat)
  &h           # Block parameter
)
end
```

**Complete Example:**

```ruby
def foo(a, b = 42, *c, d, e:, g: 42, **i, &j); end
```

This demonstrates:

- `a`: required positional parameter
- `b = 42`: optional positional parameter with default value
- `*c`: rest positional (captures remaining positional args as an array)
- `d`: post parameter (required positional after rest)
- `e:`: required keyword parameter
- `g: 42`: optional keyword parameter with default value
- `**i`: rest keyword (captures remaining keyword args as a hash)
- `&j`: block parameter

### Forward Parameters

```ruby
def foo(...) # Forwards all arguments to bar
  bar(...)
end
```

This captures and forwards all positional, keyword, and block arguments.

### Singleton Methods

Methods can be defined on individual objects or as class methods:

```ruby
class Foo
  def bar; end       # Instance method
  def self.baz; end  # Singleton method (class method)
end
```

Results in:

- `Foo#bar` - instance method
- `Foo.baz` or `Foo::baz` - singleton method

## Method Aliasing

Ruby provides two ways to create method aliases: the `alias` keyword and the `alias_method` method.

### The `alias` Keyword

The `alias` keyword creates a new name for an existing method:

```ruby
class Foo
  def bar
    "bar"
  end

  alias baz bar  # baz is now an alias for bar
end

Foo.new.baz  # => "bar"
```

Aliases can use symbols or bare method names:

```ruby
class Foo
  def original; end

  alias :new_name :original    # symbol syntax
  alias another_name original  # bare name syntax
end
```

### `alias_method`

`alias_method` is a method from `Module` that creates aliases at runtime:

```ruby
class Foo
  def bar; end

  alias_method :baz, :bar           # symbol syntax
  alias_method "qux", "bar"         # string syntax
end
```

Unlike `alias`, `alias_method` requires symbols or strings, not bare method names.

### Top-Level Aliases

Aliases can be defined at the top level but it **only** works with the `alias` keyword:

```ruby
def foo; end

alias bar foo  # Creates top-level method alias
alias_method :bar, :foo  # NoMethodError
```

### Global Variable Aliases

The `alias` keyword can also create aliases for global variables:

```ruby
$foo = 123

alias $bar $foo  # $bar is now an alias for $foo

$bar  # => 123
$bar = 456
$foo  # => 456 (they share the same value)
```

This is different from simply assigning `$bar = $foo`, which would copy the value rather than create an alias.

## Attribute Methods

Ruby provides special methods for creating getter and setter methods automatically.

**Important:** Attribute methods (`attr`, `attr_accessor`, `attr_reader`, `attr_writer`) can only be used inside class or module definitions. They are not allowed at the top level.

### Basic Attribute Methods

```ruby
class Foo
  attr_accessor :foo   # Creates both `foo` and `foo=` methods
  attr_reader :bar     # Creates only `bar` method (getter)
  attr_writer :baz     # Creates only `baz=` method (setter)
end

# NOT allowed:
# attr_accessor :top_level  # Error: undefined method `attr_accessor'
```

### Multiple Attributes

All attribute methods accept multiple symbols:

```ruby
class Foo
  attr_accessor :bar, :baz
end
```

Creates: `bar`, `bar=`, `baz`, `baz=`

Rubydex indexes `attr_accessor` as two method declarations: a reader using `AttrAccessorDefinition` with the
reader name (`foo`) and a writer using `AttrWriterDefinition` with the setter name (`foo=`). This mirrors Ruby's
two-method behavior and lets visibility changes target the reader and writer independently.

### Receiver Context

Attribute methods only work when called on `self` (implicit or explicit):

```ruby
class Foo
  attr_accessor :foo           # Works (implicit self)
  self.attr_accessor :qux      # Works (explicit self)
  foo.attr_accessor :ignored   # Does NOT work (different receiver)
end
```

### The `attr` Method with Parameters

The `attr` method has special behavior based on its arguments.

**Rules:**

1. **No second parameter:** Creates only reader

   ```ruby
   class Foo
     attr :foo   # Creates only foo (getter)
   end
   ```

2. **Second parameter is `false`:** Creates only reader

   ```ruby
   class Foo
     attr :foo, false  # Creates only foo (getter)
   end
   ```

3. **Second parameter is `true`:** Creates both reader and writer

   ```ruby
   class Foo
     attr :foo, true   # Creates both foo and foo= (getter and setter)
   end
   ```

4. **Multiple symbols/strings without second parameter:** Creates only readers for all arguments

   ```ruby
   class Foo
     attr :foo, :bar, :baz
     # Creates only: foo, bar, baz (readers only)

     attr :a, "b", "c"
     # Creates only: a, b, c (readers only)
   end
   ```

5. **Invalid second parameter:** Raises runtime error

   ```ruby
   class Foo
     attr :foo, 123  # Raises `123 is not a symbol nor a string (TypeError)`
   end
   ```

## Variable Scoping

Ruby has three types of variables distinguished by sigils: global (`$`), instance (`@`), and class (`@@`).

### Global Variables

Global variables are **not** namespaced and exist globally regardless of where they're defined:

```ruby
$foo = 1

class Foo
  $bar = 2
end
```

Both `$foo` and `$bar` are accessible globally. The class definition doesn't affect the scope of `$bar`.

### Instance Variables

Instance variables are scoped to instances of classes. When defined at the class level, they belong to the class itself (as the class is an object):

```ruby
@foo = 1           # Top-level instance variable (belongs to <main>)

class Foo
  @bar = 2         # Class instance variable (belongs to Foo object)

  def initialize
    @baz = 3       # Instance variable (belongs to instances of Foo)
  end
end
```

### Class Variables

Class variables are shared across a class and all its instances:

```ruby
class Foo
  @@bar = 2         # Class variable for Foo

  def self.bar
    @@bar
  end

  def bar
    @@bar           # Same @@bar accessible in instance methods
  end
end

# NOT allowed:
# @@foo = 1  # Error: class variable access from toplevel
```

### Multi-Assignment (Destructuring)

All variable types support multi-assignment:

```ruby
# Constants
FOO, BAR::BAZ = 1, 2

# Global variables
$foo, $bar, $baz = 1, 2, 3

# Instance variables
@foo, @bar = 1, 2

# Class variables
@@foo, @@bar = 1, 2

# Mixed with top-level references
FOO, BAR::BAZ, ::BAZ = 3, 4, 5
```

### Instance Variables vs Class Variables: Receiver vs Lexical Scoping

A critical difference between instance variables (`@`) and class variables (`@@`) is how they determine ownership when defined inside a method with an explicit receiver:

- **Instance variables** follow the **receiver** (`self` at runtime)
- **Class variables** follow **lexical scope** (where the code is written)

```ruby
class Foo; end

class Bar
  # This defines a singleton method on Foo, but lexically inside Bar
  def Foo.demo
    @ivar = "instance var"   # Belongs to <Foo> (the receiver)
    @@cvar = "class var"     # Belongs to Bar (lexical scope)
  end
end

Foo.demo

Foo.instance_variables  # => [:@ivar]
Bar.instance_variables  # => []

Foo.class_variables     # => []
Bar.class_variables     # => [:@@cvar]
```

This behavior has important implications for static analysis:

| Variable Type | Scoping Rule | In `def Foo.demo` inside `class Bar` |
|---------------|--------------|--------------------------------------|
| `@ivar`       | Receiver     | Belongs to `Foo`                     |
| `@@cvar`      | Lexical      | Belongs to `Bar`                     |

The same applies to `class << Foo` blocks defined inside another class:

```ruby
class Foo; end

class Bar
  class << Foo
    def another_demo
      @ivar2 = 1   # Belongs to Foo (receiver is Foo's singleton)
      @@cvar2 = 2  # Belongs to Bar (lexical scope)
    end
  end
end

Foo.another_demo

Foo.instance_variables  # => [:@ivar2]
Bar.class_variables     # => [:@@cvar2]
```

## Mixins

Ruby provides three ways to mix modules into classes or other modules: `include`, `prepend`, and `extend`.

### Include

`include` inserts the module into the ancestor chain **after** the class, making the module's constants, methods, and module variables available:

```ruby
module Foo; end

class Bar
  include Foo
end

Bar.ancestors  # => [Bar, Foo, Object, Kernel, BasicObject]
```

### Prepend

`prepend` inserts the module into the ancestor chain **before** the class:

```ruby
module Foo; end

class Bar
  prepend Foo
end

Bar.ancestors  # => [Foo, Bar, Object, Kernel, BasicObject]
```

### Extend

`extend` adds module methods as **singleton methods** (class methods when used in a class):

```ruby
module Foo
  def bar; end
end

class Baz
  extend Foo
end

Baz.bar  # Works (class method)
Baz.new.bar  # NoMethodError (not an instance method)
```

#### Extend Self Pattern

A common pattern is `extend self` to make module methods callable on the module itself:

```ruby
module Foo
  extend self

  def bar
    "bar"
  end
end

Foo.bar  # => "bar"
```

#### Extend vs Include in Singleton Class

`extend Foo` is functionally equivalent to `class << self; include Foo; end` - both add methods to the singleton class. However, they trigger **different hooks**:

```ruby
module Foo
  def self.included(base)
    puts "included hook called on #{base}"
  end

  def self.extended(base)
    puts "extended hook called on #{base}"
  end
end

class UsingExtend
  extend Foo  # Triggers: "extended hook called on UsingExtend"
end

class UsingSingletonInclude
  class << self
    include Foo  # Triggers: "included hook called on #<Class:UsingSingletonInclude>"
  end
end
```

Both classes get the same methods, but:

- `extend` calls the `extended` hook
- `include` in singleton class calls the `included` hook

### Multiple Mixins

Multiple modules can be mixed in a single call:

```ruby
class Foo
  include Bar, Baz   # Baz is included first, then Bar
  prepend Qux, Quux  # Quux is prepended first, then Qux
end
```

### Mixin Deduplication

Ruby **removes duplicate modules** from the ancestor chain:

```ruby
module A; end

module B
  include A
end

class Foo
  include A
  include B
end

Foo.ancestors  # => [Foo, B, A, Object, ...]
# A appears only once, not twice
```

**Indirect duplicates** are also removed:

```ruby
module A; end

module B
  include A
end

module C
  include A
end

module Foo
  include B
  include C
end

Foo.ancestors  # => [Foo, C, B, A]
# A appears only once despite being in both B and C
```

When both parent and child include the same module, Ruby deduplicates it - the module appears **once** in the ancestor chain:

```ruby
module A; end

module B
  include A
end

class Parent
  include B
end

class Child < Parent
  include B
end

Child.ancestors  # => [Child, Parent, B, A, Object, ...]
# B and A appear once (child's include is deduplicated against parent)
```

### Top-Level Mixins

Mixins at the top level affect `Object`:

```ruby
include Foo  # Makes Foo's methods available everywhere
```

**Note:** `include self`, `prepend self`, or `extend self` at the top level is invalid and will produce an error:

```ruby
include self # => TypeError: wrong argument type Object (expected Module)
prepend self # => NoMethodError: undefined method 'prepend' for main
extend self  # => TypeError: wrong argument type Object (expected Module)
```

### Cyclic Mixins

`include self` and `prepend self` inside a module are rejected as cyclic:

```ruby
module Foo
  include self # => ArgumentError: cyclic include detected
end

module Bar
  prepend self # => ArgumentError: cyclic prepend detected
end
```

`extend self` inside a module is valid (see [Extend Self Pattern](#extend-self-pattern) above).

## Visibility

Ruby provides three visibility levels for methods: `public`, `private`, and `protected`.

### Default Visibility

Methods defined at the **top level** default to `private`:

```ruby
def foo; end  # private by default at top level

public

def bar; end  # now public (after public modifier)
```

Methods defined **inside a class or module** default to `public`:

```ruby
class Foo
  def bar; end  # public by default
end
```

### Visibility Modifiers

Visibility can be changed using `public`, `private`, or `protected` inside class and module bodies. At the top level, only `public` and `private` are available; calling `protected` on `main` raises `NameError`.

```ruby
class Foo
  def m1; end      # public (default)

  private

  def m2; end      # private (after modifier)

  protected def m3; end  # protected (inline modifier)
end
```

### Access Rules

- **`public`**: No restrictions — callable from anywhere with any receiver.
- **`private`**: A private method defined anywhere in the ancestor chain can be called on `self` — either implicitly or explicitly as `self.method`. Calling it on any other object, even an instance of the same class, raises `NoMethodError`.
- **`protected`**: Like `private`, but also allows calls on other objects as long as both `self` and the receiver have the defining class or module in their ancestor chain.

The key distinction between `private` and `protected` is cross-instance access:

```ruby
class Account
  def initialize(balance)
    @balance = balance
  end

  def >(other)
    balance > other.balance  # works — other is also an Account
  end

  protected
  def balance; @balance; end
end

a = Account.new(100)
b = Account.new(50)
a > b  # => true (cross-instance protected call succeeds)
```

With `private`, the same pattern fails because `other.balance` uses an explicit receiver that isn't `self`:

```ruby
class Wallet
  def initialize(amount)
    @amount = amount
  end

  def >(other)
    amount > other.amount  # NoMethodError — private method called on other
  end

  private
  def amount; @amount; end
end
```

**Protected access extends to subclasses:**

```ruby
class SavingsAccount < Account
  def compare(other)
    balance > other.balance  # works — both are in the Account hierarchy
  end
end
```

An unrelated class cannot call protected methods, even with a reference to the object:

```ruby
class Auditor
  def inspect_balance(account)
    account.balance  # NoMethodError — Auditor is not in Account's hierarchy
  end
end
```

**Protected access also works between unrelated classes that share a module in their ancestors:**

```ruby
module HasBalance
  protected
  def balance; @balance; end
end

class Account
  include HasBalance
  def initialize(balance) = @balance = balance
  def >(other) = balance > other.balance
end

class Wallet
  include HasBalance
  def initialize(balance) = @balance = balance
  def >(other) = balance > other.balance
end

Account.new(100) > Account.new(50)  # => true (same class)
Wallet.new(100) > Account.new(50)   # => true (unrelated classes, but both include HasBalance)
```

`Account` and `Wallet` share no inheritance relationship, but both include `HasBalance`. Since the defining module is in both ancestor chains, protected cross-instance calls work between them.

### Visibility Resets in Nested Scopes

**Important:** Visibility modifiers do NOT propagate into nested class or module definitions:

```ruby
private

class Foo
  def m1; end      # public (resets in new scope)

  private

  module Bar
    def m2; end    # public (resets again)
  end

  def m3; end      # private (still in Foo's private scope)
end
```

### Visibility Does NOT Apply to `def self.method`

Visibility modifiers have **no effect** on singleton methods defined with `def self.method`:

```ruby
class Foo
  private

  def self.bar; end  # STILL PUBLIC (visibility ignored)
  # private_class_method :bar can turn `bar` private
end

Foo.bar  # Works fine
```

**Important:** This does NOT apply inside `class << self` blocks - visibility works normally there:

```ruby
class Foo
  class << self
    private

    def bar; end  # Actually private
  end
end

Foo.bar  # private method 'bar' called for class Foo (NoMethodError)
```

### Retroactive Visibility (`private :method_name`)

Visibility can be changed retroactively by passing a method name as a symbol to `private`, `protected`, or `public`:

```ruby
class Foo
  def foo; end
  def bar; end
  private :foo          # retroactively makes foo private
end
Foo.public_instance_methods(false)   # => [:bar]
Foo.private_instance_methods(false)  # => [:foo]
```

- Accepts multiple symbols: `private :a, :b`
- Returns the symbol(s): `private :foo` returns `:foo`, `private :a, :b` returns `[:a, :b]`
- `protected :foo` and `public :foo` work the same way

**`private` is a private method on Module:**

```ruby
Foo.private(:foo)  # => NoMethodError: private method 'private' called for class Foo
Foo.send(:private, :foo)  # works (bypasses visibility check)
```

Unlike `private_constant` and `private_class_method` which are public methods, `private`/`protected`/`public` cannot be called with an explicit receiver from outside.

**Works across reopened classes:**

```ruby
class Foo; def foo; end; end
class Foo; private :foo; end  # works — retroactive across reopen
Foo.private_instance_methods(false)  # => [:foo]
```

The method must already exist when the visibility call runs. Within one file, `private :foo` before `def foo` matches
Ruby's `NameError` behavior. Across files, Rubydex cannot know runtime load order, so it treats cross-file definitions
as potentially available. A definitely-prior same-file definition is preferred for the visibility snapshot; URI lexical
order is used only as a deterministic tie-breaker when multiple cross-file definitions could apply.

Rubydex treats visibility calls inside method bodies or ordinary blocks as runtime calls. It does not apply those
visibility effects statically because Ruby only executes them if the containing method or block is called.

**`private :inherited_method` creates an implicit copy:**

```ruby
class Parent
  def inherited_method; "parent"; end
end
class Child < Parent
  private :inherited_method
end
Parent.new.respond_to?(:inherited_method)  # => true (parent unaffected)
Child.new.respond_to?(:inherited_method)   # => false (private on child)
Child.instance_method(:inherited_method).owner  # => Child (NOT Parent!)
```

Ruby creates an implicit method entry on the child class. The owner is `Child`, not `Parent`. This means `private :inherited_method` effectively creates a definition, not just modifying one. The parent is unaffected.

### `private_class_method` / `public_class_method`

`private_class_method` makes singleton methods (class methods) private:

```ruby
class Foo
  def self.hidden; end
  private_class_method :hidden
end
Foo.hidden  # => NoMethodError: private method 'hidden' called for class Foo
```

**Inline form:**

```ruby
class Foo
  private_class_method def self.secret; "secret"; end
end
Foo.secret  # => NoMethodError
```

**Common pattern — `private_class_method :new`:**

```ruby
class Singleton
  private_class_method :new
  def self.create; new; end  # internal access works
end
Singleton.new     # => NoMethodError
Singleton.create  # => #<Singleton:0x...>
```

`public_class_method` reverses `private_class_method`. Both are public methods on `Module`, callable from anywhere with a receiver.

**Note:** `private_singleton_method` does not exist in Ruby. The correct API is `private_class_method`.

### Retroactive `module_function :method_name`

`module_function` can be called with a method name, or with no arguments to affect later method definitions, but only
inside module bodies. It is not available at the top level, inside class bodies, or inside singleton class bodies:

```ruby
module Foo
  def foo; "foo"; end
  module_function :foo
end
Foo.foo                               # => "foo" (public singleton)
Foo.public_instance_methods(false)    # => []
Foo.private_instance_methods(false)   # => [:foo] (instance becomes private)
Foo.singleton_methods(false)          # => [:foo]
```

Ruby can invoke `module_function` indirectly with `send` on a module object. Rubydex indexes the direct call forms above;
dynamic `send` calls are treated as ordinary method calls rather than visibility operations.

Like other visibility operations, Rubydex treats `module_function` calls inside method bodies or ordinary blocks as
runtime calls rather than static visibility operations.

**Creates a copy, not a reference:**

```ruby
module Foo
  def foo; "v1"; end
  module_function :foo
  def foo; "v2"; end   # redefines instance method
end
Foo.foo  # => "v1" (singleton is an independent copy of v1)
```

The copied method may come from an ancestor. Ruby installs both a direct private instance method entry and a direct
singleton method entry on the receiving module, while preserving the source method's location and signature:

```ruby
module A
  def foo(x); "v1"; end
end

module B
  include A
  module_function :foo
end

B.method(:foo).source_location       # => ["a.rb", 2] when A was loaded from a.rb
B.method(:foo).parameters            # => [[:req, :x]]
B.private_instance_methods(false)    # => [:foo]
B.singleton_methods(false)           # => [:foo]
```

Later changes to `A#foo` do not mutate the already copied runtime method on `B`. A static indexer still needs to
invalidate and rebuild generated copies when the source file changes, because a fresh load of the current files would
copy the current source method at the `module_function :foo` call.

When the source method and `module_function :foo` call are in different files, static indexing does not know runtime
load order. Rubydex treats cross-file source methods as potentially available and uses URI lexical order only as a
deterministic tie-breaker when multiple cross-file definitions could be copied. A definitely-prior same-file source
method is preferred over cross-file candidates. Within one file, the source method must
appear before the `module_function :foo` call, matching Ruby's `NameError` behavior for calls that appear before the
method definition.

Method aliases are eligible targets. `module_function :bar` after `alias bar foo` copies the current `foo` method body
under the singleton name `bar`, while also making `bar` a private instance method on the module:

```ruby
module Foo
  def foo(x); x; end
  alias bar foo
  module_function :bar
end

Foo.bar(1)                         # => 1
Foo.private_instance_methods(false) # => [:bar]
Foo.singleton_methods(false)        # => [:bar]
```

Attribute writers use the setter method name. `attr_writer :foo` defines `foo=`, not `foo`, so
`module_function :foo` fails while `module_function :foo=` creates a public singleton writer copy:

```ruby
module Foo
  attr_writer :foo
  module_function :foo=  # copies Foo#foo= to Foo.foo=
end

module Foo
  attr_writer :bar
  module_function :bar   # raises NameError
end
```

### Constant Visibility

Ruby provides `private_constant` and `public_constant` to control constant visibility.

#### `private_constant`

```ruby
class Foo
  CONST = 1
  private_constant :CONST
  def use_const; CONST; end   # works — internal access OK
end
Foo::CONST   # => NameError: private constant Foo::CONST referenced
Foo.constants  # => [] (private constants hidden from .constants)
```

- Accepts symbols (`:CONST`) and strings (`"CONST"`)
- Accepts multiple args: `private_constant :A, :B`
- Works on classes AND modules, including nested classes: `private_constant :Inner`
- `Foo.constants` excludes private constants
- `Foo.const_defined?(:PRIV)` returns **true** even for private constants — visibility doesn't affect `const_defined?`
- `Foo.const_get(:PRIV)` **bypasses** private constant visibility and returns the value — only the `::` operator enforces `private_constant`

Rubydex treats `private_constant`/`public_constant` calls inside method bodies or ordinary blocks as runtime calls rather
than static visibility operations.

#### `public_constant`

Reverses `private_constant`:

```ruby
class Foo
  CONST = 1
  private_constant :CONST
  public_constant :CONST
end
Foo::CONST  # => 1 (accessible again)
```

#### Scoping: Targets the Receiver

`private_constant` is a public method on `Module` — callable from anywhere with a receiver. It targets the receiver, not the lexical scope:

```ruby
module Bar
  CONST = 1
  class Foo
    CONST = 2
    private_constant(:CONST)     # targets Foo::CONST (self is Foo)
    Bar.private_constant(:CONST) # targets Bar::CONST (explicit receiver)
  end
end
Bar::CONST      # => NameError (blocked by explicit receiver call)
Bar::Foo::CONST # => NameError (blocked by bare call inside Foo)
```

#### NOT Available at Top Level

```ruby
private_constant :FOO  # => NoMethodError: undefined method 'private_constant' for main
public_constant :FOO   # => NoMethodError: undefined method 'public_constant' for main
```

`self` at top level is `main` (an Object instance), not a Module, so neither API is available there.

#### Constant Visibility and Inheritance

Private constants block external access but NOT internal or inherited access:

```ruby
class Parent
  CONST = 1
  private_constant :CONST
  def use_const; CONST; end
end

class Child < Parent
  def try_const; CONST; end
end

Parent.new.use_const    # => 1 (internal access works)
Child.new.try_const     # => 1 (inherited access through method works)
Child::CONST            # => NameError (direct external access blocked)
```

Private constants from included modules are also blocked externally:

```ruby
module Mod
  CONST = 1
  private_constant :CONST
end
class Foo; include Mod; end
Foo::CONST  # => NameError
```

#### Method Visibility Modifiers Do Not Affect Constants

The `private`/`protected` visibility modifiers have no effect on constants. Only `private_constant` controls constant visibility:

```ruby
class Foo
  private
  CONST = 42
end
Foo::CONST  # => 42 (still public)
Foo.constants  # => [:CONST]
```

### Alias Visibility

Both `alias` and `alias_method` copy the **source method's visibility** at the time of aliasing, regardless of the current visibility stack:

```ruby
class Foo
  def pub; end    # public
  private
  alias copy pub  # copy is PUBLIC (copies source, ignores stack)
end
Foo.public_instance_methods(false)   # => [:copy, :pub]
Foo.private_instance_methods(false)  # => []
```

```ruby
class Foo
  def foo; end
  private
  alias_method :bar, :foo  # bar is PUBLIC (same behavior as alias)
end
Foo.public_instance_methods(false)   # => [:bar, :foo]
Foo.private_instance_methods(false)  # => []
```

**Aliases don't track later visibility changes:**

```ruby
class Foo
  def foo; end
  alias bar foo       # bar is public (same as foo at this point)
  private :foo        # foo becomes private
end
Foo.public_instance_methods(false)   # => [:bar]
Foo.private_instance_methods(false)  # => [:foo]
```

## Constant References

Constants in Ruby can be referenced before they're defined, and resolution depends on lexical scope.

### Unresolved References

A constant reference may not immediately resolve to a definition:

```ruby
module Foo
  BAR  # Could be Foo::BAR or top-level BAR - depends on what exists
end
```

Resolution depends on:

1. What constants are defined
2. The lexical scope chain
3. Whether it's a top-level reference (`::BAR`)

### Top-Level Constant References

Constants prefixed with `::` are resolved by searching the ancestors of `Object`. This means they can find constants defined in `Kernel` or other modules included into `Object`, not just constants owned by `Object` directly:

```ruby
module Kernel
  FOO = 1
end

module Foo
  ::FOO  # Found through Object's ancestors (Kernel)
  ::Bar  # Always defined through the ancestors of `Object`
  Baz    # Could be defined in `Foo` or in the ancestors of `Object`
end
```

This works even inside classes that don't inherit from `Object`:

```ruby
module Kernel
  FOO = 1
end

class Bar < BasicObject
  ::FOO  # Resolves through Object's ancestors, not through Bar's
end
```

### Resolution Examples

```ruby
module Foo
  class Bar
    ::Bar      # Resolves to top-level Bar (if it exists)
    ::Baz      # Resolves to top-level Baz (if it exists)
    String     # Searches: Foo::Bar::String, Foo::String, ::String
    ::Object   # Resolves to top-level Object
  end
end

class Bar
  ::Foo::Bar   # Explicit path to Foo::Bar
end
```

**Lexical scope resolution for unqualified constants (like `String` above):**

1. Current namespace (Foo::Bar::String)
2. Each enclosing lexical scope (Foo::String)

After lexical scopes are exhausted, Ruby searches the ancestor chain. See [Constant Resolution Through Inheritance](#constant-resolution-through-inheritance) for the full algorithm.

### Inheritance Chain Resolution

Ruby builds ancestors through the following steps recursively:

1. Prepended modules (in reverse order of prepending)
2. Current class
3. Included modules (in reverse order of inclusion)
4. Parent class

And then it continues up the inheritance chain.

```rb
module PrependedInPrepended
end

module Prepended
  prepend PrependedInPrepended
end

module PrependedInIncluded
  prepend PrependedInPrepended
end

module IncludedInIncluded
end

module Included
  include IncludedInIncluded
end

class Foo
end

class Bar < Foo
  prepend Prepended
  include Included
end

puts Bar.ancestors.to_s
#=> [PrependedInPrepended, Prepended, Bar, Included, IncludedInIncluded, Foo, Object, Kernel, BasicObject]
```

### Constant Resolution Through Inheritance

Ruby also searches the ancestor chain when resolving constants:

```ruby
class Parent
  CONST = "from parent"
end

class Child < Parent
  def show
    CONST  # Resolves to Parent::CONST through inheritance
  end
end

Child.new.show  # => "from parent"
```

**Resolution order:**

1. Lexical scopes (current namespace, then each enclosing scope)
2. [Ancestor chain](#inheritance-chain-resolution) of the innermost enclosing class or module
3. For modules only: ancestors of `Object`

There is no separate "top-level fallback" for classes. Top-level constants like `String` are owned by `Object`, which appears in the ancestor chain of most classes. This can be confirmed because a class inheriting from `BasicObject` (which does not have `Object` in its ancestors) cannot resolve top-level constants:

```ruby
class Foo < BasicObject
  String  # NameError: Foo doesn't have Object in its ancestor chain
end
```

When using constants at the top level of a script, they resolve because `<main>` is an instance of `Object`:

```ruby
String  # Works because <main> is Object. Resolved through inheritance
```

The module fallback searches the full ancestor chain of `Object`, not just `Object` directly:

```ruby
module Kernel
  FOO = 1
end

module Bar
  FOO  # Resolves through Object's ancestors (Kernel)
end
```

**Example with modules:**

```ruby
module M
  CONST = "from module"
end

class Parent
  CONST = "from parent"
end

class Child < Parent
  include M

  def show
    CONST  # Resolves to M::CONST (included module takes precedence)
  end
end
```

### Constant Paths

Ruby supports qualified constant paths:

```ruby
module Foo
  class Bar
    Object::String  # Explicit path: Object must exist, then String within it
  end
end
```

Constant paths are resolved left-to-right: `Object` is resolved first, then `String` is looked up within `Object`.

## Constant Aliases

Constants can be assigned to reference other constants, creating **aliases**:

```ruby
module Foo
  CONST = 123
end

ALIAS = Foo
ALIAS::CONST  # Resolves to Foo::CONST (123)
```

### Chained Aliases

Aliases can reference other aliases, forming chains:

```ruby
module Foo
  CONST = 123
end

ALIAS1 = Foo
ALIAS2 = ALIAS1
ALIAS2::CONST  # Resolves through ALIAS2 -> ALIAS1 -> Foo -> Foo::CONST
```

### Scoped Aliases

Aliases can be defined within namespaces:

```ruby
module Foo
  CONST = 1
end

module Bar
  MyFoo = Foo  # Bar::MyFoo is an alias for Foo
end

Bar::MyFoo::CONST  # Resolves to Foo::CONST
```

Aliases can also be assigned using qualified paths:

```ruby
module Foo; end
module Bar; end

Bar::ALIAS = Foo  # Creates Bar::ALIAS pointing to Foo
```

### Conditional Aliases

The `||=` operator can create conditional aliases:

```ruby
ALIAS ||= Foo  # Only assigns if ALIAS is not already defined
```

### Defining Classes Or Modules Under Aliased Path

Ruby allows defining classes or modules under aliases. The defined class/module will have its fully qualified name based on the alias target, not the alias itself. For example:

```ruby
class Foo; end
ALIAS = Foo

class ALIAS::Bar; end
ALIAS::Bar.name # Foo::Bar, not ALIAS::Bar
```

## Singleton Classes

Ruby can create a *singleton class* for most objects, but it usually materializes that class lazily the first time
singleton-specific syntax/methods are used.

- Defining singleton behavior (`def self.*`, `class << Foo`, `extend`, etc.) forces Ruby to create the singleton class if it was not created already.
- Calling `Foo.singleton_class` also forces creation and returns the singleton class object.
- Plain objects behave the same way: `obj.singleton_class` or `def obj.special` allocates one lazily for that object.
- Classes and modules that never reference their singleton class may run indefinitely without allocating it.
- Certain objects can never have singleton classes: integers, floats, symbols, and frozen strings. Calling `singleton_class` on them raises `TypeError`.
- Ruby boots with singleton classes for `true`, `false`, and `nil` already created.

Calling `Foo.new` does **not** force Foo's singleton class to exist. The `new` method is defined on `Class`
itself, so every class object inherits it automatically. Unless you override `Foo.new` via
`def self.new` (which would then create the singleton class) Ruby can instantiate `Foo` instances without ever
materializing `Foo`'s singleton class.

```ruby
Class.instance_method(:new).owner
# => Class
```

The singleton class is the receiver for `def self.*`, `class << self`, and it is where modules mixed in via `extend`
actually insert their methods.

```ruby
class Foo
  class << self # reopens (or creates) Foo's singleton class
    A = 1
    def bar; A; end
  end

  def self.baz; end # adds the method to Foo's singleton class

  @ivar = 1 # assigns a class instance variable on Foo's singleton class (NOT a class variable)
end
```

### Lexical Scope vs Singleton Receiver

- Inside the class body the current *receiver* (`self`) is `Foo`, so `@ivar` writes to the singleton class and `def self.baz`
  defines a singleton method.
- Lexical constant lookup still follows the surrounding constant scope, so constants created inside `class << self` do not
  become `Foo::CONST`.

```ruby
class Foo
  @counter = 0

  class << self
    A = 1

    def bar
      @counter += 1      # valid: singleton ivar
      puts A             # valid: constant defined in this singleton scope
    end
  end

  def self.baz
    puts @counter        # valid: reads the singleton's @counter
    puts A               # NameError: Foo::A is not defined
  end
end
```

If a constant must be visible as `Foo::CONST`, define it in the regular class body instead of inside a `class << self`
block.

### Reopening Singleton Class Explicitly

The singleton class can be reopened anywhere with `class << Foo` as long as the constant already exists:

```ruby
# file: foo.rb
class Foo; end

# file: foo_singleton.rb
class << Foo
  def bar!
    puts "bar"
  end
end

# file: my_class.rb
class MyClass
  # This also reopens Foo's singleton class
  class << Foo
    def baz!
      puts "baz"
    end
  end
end

Foo.bar!
Foo.baz!
```

### Class Variables and Singleton Classes

Class variables (`@@var`) **bypass singleton classes entirely**.
They always belong to the base class or module, regardless of where they are defined:

```ruby
class Foo
  @@in_class_body = 1

  class << self
    @@in_singleton_scope = 2

    def set_var
      @@in_method = 3
    end
  end
end

Foo.set_var

# All class variables belong to Foo, not its singleton class
Foo.class_variables
# => [:@@in_class_body, :@@in_singleton_scope, :@@in_method]

Foo.singleton_class.class_variables
# => [:@@in_class_body, :@@in_singleton_scope, :@@in_method]  # inherited view

# The singleton class itself owns no class variables
Foo.singleton_class.class_variables(false)
# => []
```

This is fundamentally different from instance variables (`@var`), which **do** belong to the singleton class when
defined in class scope:

```ruby
class Foo
  @class_ivar = 1  # belongs to Foo's singleton class
  @@class_var = 2  # belongs to Foo itself
end
```

Top-level class variable access (`@@foo = 1` outside any class) raises `RuntimeError: class variable access from toplevel`.

### Nested Singleton Classes

`class << self` can be nested. Each nesting opens the singleton class of the current `self`:

```ruby
class Foo
  class << self
    # self is now Foo.singleton_class
    def on_foo_singleton; end

    class << self
      # self is now Foo.singleton_class.singleton_class
      def on_singleton_singleton; end
    end
  end
end

# on_foo_singleton is callable on Foo
Foo.on_foo_singleton

# on_singleton_singleton is NOT callable on Foo
Foo.on_singleton_singleton
# => NoMethodError

# It's callable on Foo's singleton class
Foo.singleton_class.on_singleton_singleton
```

The ownership chain is: `Foo` → `Foo.singleton_class` → `Foo.singleton_class.singleton_class`.

## Anonymous Classes And Modules

`Class.new` and `Module.new` create anonymous class/module objects. When assigned to a constant, that constant names the new namespace.

### Method receivers and `self`

Inside the block, `self` is the newly created class/module.

```ruby
Foo = Class.new do
  def self.foo; end   # class method on Foo
  def bar; end        # instance method on Foo instances
  alias_method :baz, :bar
end
```

You can still access those methods even when the anonymous class isn't assigned to a constant:

```ruby
c = Class.new do
  def self.foo; end
  def bar; end
end

c.foo
c.new.bar
```

### Instance variables

Instance variables behave the same as in regular class definitions:

```ruby
Foo = Class.new do
  @class_ivar = 1     # instance variable of the Foo class
  def initialize
    @ivar = 2         # instance variable of Foo instances
  end
end
```

### Class variables and constants

Class variables and constants follow lexical scope (`Module.nesting`). `Class.new`/`Module.new` blocks do **not** change lexical scope, so unqualified constants and class variables are defined in the outer scope, not on the new class/module.

```ruby
class Outer
  Foo = Class.new do
    @@cvar = 1 # this belongs to Outer, not Foo
  end
end
```

Defining class variables in a top-level anonymous class/module results in an error:

```ruby
Foo = Class.new do
  @@cvar = 1   # RuntimeError: class variable access from toplevel
end
```

Similar to class variables, constants are attached to the closest lexical scope, not the anonymous class/module:

```ruby
Foo = Class.new do
  CONST = 2
end

defined?(Foo::CONST)  # => nil
defined?(::CONST)     # => "constant"
```

If you want constants under the new class/module, use `self::CONST` or define them after the assignment.

```ruby
Foo = Class.new do
  self::CONST = 2
end

Foo::CONST
```

### Namespaces and lexical nesting

The block does **not** introduce lexical nesting for `class`/`module` definitions:

```ruby
class Foo
  Bar = Class.new do
    class Baz; end
  end
end

# Baz is Foo::Baz, not Foo::Bar::Baz
```

You cannot reliably reference the assigned constant inside the block because the assignment happens after the block runs. `Bar::Baz` inside the block refers to an outer `Bar` (if any) or raises `NameError`. Using `self::Bar` as a superclass also fails because `self` is the anonymous class, not the outer scope:

```ruby
class Foo
  Bar = Class.new do
    class Baz < Bar; end       # NameError: uninitialized constant Foo::Bar
    class Baz < self::Bar; end # NameError: uninitialized constant #<Class:...>::Bar
  end
end
```

To define classes or constants under the new class, use `class self::Baz` or `self::Baz = Class.new` (or `const_set`) inside the block, or define them after the assignment:

```ruby
class Foo
  Bar = Class.new do
    class self::Baz; end      # defines Foo::Bar::Baz
    self::Qux = Class.new     # defines Foo::Bar::Qux
  end
end

# or
class Foo
  Bar = Class.new
  Bar::Baz = Class.new
end
```

### Nested anonymous Class.new/Module.new

The rules above apply to nested anonymous class/module definitions as well.

For example, constants defined in nested anonymous classes are still attached to the closest lexical scope:

```ruby
Foo = Class.new do
  Class.new do
    CONST = 1
  end
end

# CONST is defined on top-level, the closest lexical scope, instead of Foo
defined?(CONST) #=> "constant"
defined?(Foo::CONST) #=> nil
```

### Singleton class blocks inside anonymous classes

Although `Class.new`/`Module.new` blocks do not create lexical scopes, `class << self` blocks inside them still do. Constants and class variables defined inside such a singleton class block are attached to the singleton class:

```ruby
Foo = Class.new do
  class << self
    CONST = 1
  end
end

Foo.singleton_class.constants  # => [:CONST]
Foo.constants                  # => []
```

This also applies to nested anonymous classes within the singleton class block:

```ruby
Foo = Class.new do
  class << self
    Class.new do
      CONST = 1
    end
  end
end

Foo.singleton_class.constants  # => [:CONST]
```
